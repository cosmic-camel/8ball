# 8ball
A collection of meaningless commands for bash shell



Current Game Plan: 

- Magic 8 ball 
- Some sort of error scavenger hunt. 
- running count of all the commands that have been entered. Perhaps errors?
- Make the readme a bit more professional for this extremely professional, serious project.
