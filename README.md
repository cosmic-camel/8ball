# 8ball
A collection of meaningless commands for bash shell


NOT READY FOR INSTALL

Current Useless bash shell commands:

shake: will give an 8 ball prediction

nope there's really nothing else at the moment.

Current Game Plan:

- Some sort of error scavenger hunt.
    - thinking that this idea can be discarded for now
- running count of all the commands that have been entered. Perhaps errors?
    - running count of errors is made. user is notified when they've made a new error, or during major error milestones
    - oopsie, this might actually be useful
- Make the readme a bit more professional for this extremely professional, serious project.

Structure:

- Will install by sourcing a file to bashrc. This file should have commands or something
- will also need a file (or several) for storing data (ex. list of errors that the user has made)
    - 8 ball responses
    - errors (and their count)
