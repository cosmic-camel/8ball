# 8ball
A collection of meaningless commands for bash shell



Current Game Plan: 

- Magic 8 ball
    - command is entered (with a question). 8 ball is shook and gives the user an answer to their question
- Some sort of error scavenger hunt. 
    - thinking that this idea can be discarded for now 
- running count of all the commands that have been entered. Perhaps errors?
    - running count of errors is made. user is notified when they've made a new error, or during major error milestones 
    - oopsie, this might actually be useful
- Make the readme a bit more professional for this extremely professional, serious project. 

Structure: 

- Will install by sourcing a file to bashrc. This file should have commands or something
- will also need a file (or several) for storing data (ex. list of errors that the user has made)
    - 8 ball responses
    - errors (and their count)
